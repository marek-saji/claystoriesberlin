  In this introduction to handbuilding you will learn techniques like slab building, making pinch pots and coiling to
  shape your own distinctive pieces. You will also learn to experiment with surface decoration, including texturing and
  working with engobes, to add depth and character to your creations. Finished pieces (2-3) will be glazed by us in the glaze
  of your choice and will be ready to pick up in about 3-4 weeks.

  We invite you to explore the process with curiosity, enjoy the feel of the clay, and discover the unique pieces you
  are capable of making.
