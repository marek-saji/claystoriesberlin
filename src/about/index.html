<p>
We're Rachel and Ania, two ceramic artists, passionate about clay and visual storytelling.
</p>

<p>Ania Margoszczyn is a Polish ceramicist based in Berlin, creating functional works with a focus on minimalist tea ceramics. Her pieces are created to enrich daily rituals, uniting simple forms with quiet utility. 
<br><br>
Drawing inspiration from nature and her travels, Ania incorporates processes such as woodfiring, the use of wild clay and ash glazes, while also exploring sustainable and circular approaches to ceramics. 
<br><br>
By working with local wild clays and embracing processes that highlight the interconnectedness of making, place, and environment, she ensures that each vessel carries both individuality and a strong sense of place.<br><br>https://www.instagram.com/liski.ceramics/</p>

We're looking forward to welcoming you to our pottery studio and sharing our love for clay with you.
