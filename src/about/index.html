<p>
We're Rachel and Ania, two ceramic artists, passionate about clay and visual storytelling.
</p>
<img alt="" src="./rachel selter ceramics.jpg" />
<p>Rachel is originally from South-West England and has lived in Berlin for the past ten years. Growing up with a potter as a mother, she was introduced to clay from an early age and learned to value the process of making just as much as the finished piece. <br><br>
With a long-standing affinity for surface design, Rachel first built her career in the textiles and fashion industry in London and Berlin before discovering her true passion in ceramics. Today, she focuses on handbuilding and sculptural techniques, guiding students of all ages to trust their hands and to explore clay as both a creative medium and a powerful therapeutic tool.

<p>Ania Margoszczyn is a Polish ceramicist based in Berlin, creating functional works with a focus on minimalist tea ceramics. <br><br>
Drawing inspiration from nature and her travels, Ania incorporates processes such as woodfiring, the use of wild clay and ash glazes, while also exploring sustainable and circular approaches to ceramics. <br><br> By working with local wild clays and embracing processes that highlight the interconnectedness of making, place, and environment, she ensures that each vessel carries both individuality and a strong sense of place.
