  Teambuilding events are a great way to foster collaboration and creativity among colleagues.
  We will guide your team through the process of creating unique ceramic pieces, promoting teamwork.
  We offer workshops both in our studio or in your chosen space, providing a unique and memorable experience for your team.

During the warmer months we also organize outdoor ceramic workshops in a beautiful greenhouse on a flower farm, where you can connect with nature while creating your own pottery.</p>
