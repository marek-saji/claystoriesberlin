<p>
Teambuilding events are a great way to foster collaboration and creativity among colleagues. We will guide your team
through the process of creating unique ceramic pieces, promoting teamwork. We offer workshops both in our studio or
in your chosen space, providing a unique and memorable experience for your team.
</p>

<p>
If you would like to organise a kids event in our studio, please get in touch with us for more information about
available dates and pricing.

During the warmer months we also organize outdoor ceramic workshops in a beautiful greenhouse on a flower farm,
where you can connect with nature while creating your own pottery.
